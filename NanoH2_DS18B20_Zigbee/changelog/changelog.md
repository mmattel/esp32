## 2.0.2 — converter only, no reflash required

**Fixed:** three expose names in `nanoh2-ds18b20.mjs` contained parentheses
(`reading_interval_(s)`, `reporting_delta_(c)`, `temperature_correction_(c)`).
Home Assistant rejects MQTT discovery topics that contain `(` or `)`, so those three
entities were never registered in HA. Parentheses replaced with underscores:
`reading_interval_s`, `reporting_delta_c`, `temperature_correction_c`.

Update both copies of the converter (sketch folder and Z2M `external_converters/`),
then re-interview the device in Z2M so the corrected entity names are published.
No firmware change; the ESP32 does not need to be reflashed.

## 2.0.1

Initial stable release. Firmware and converter shipped together and work as designed:
three DS18B20 temperature sensors, configurable reading interval and reporting delta,
temperature correction per device, LQI/RSSI link quality, console mirror, and firmware
version endpoint. No known issues at release.
